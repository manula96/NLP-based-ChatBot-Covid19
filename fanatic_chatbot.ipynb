after exposure.', 'This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period.', 'Common signs and symptoms can include:\\n\\nFever\\n\\nCough\\n\\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\\n\\nOther symptoms can include:\\n\\nTiredness\\n\\nAches\\n\\nChills\\n\\nSore throat\\n\\nLoss of smell\\n\\nLoss of taste\\n\\nHeadache\\n\\nDiarrhea\\n\\nSevere vomiting\\n\\nThe severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe.', 'Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all.', 'People who are older or who have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, severe obesity, chronic kidney or liver disease, or who have compromised immune systems may be at higher risk of serious illness.', 'This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza.', 'Some people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of breath

contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters).', 'The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks.', 'These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.', 'It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes.', 'Risk factors\\n\\nRisk factors for

who has COVID-19 , , such as being within 6 feet, or 2 meters, or being coughed on — which can occur when a family member or health care worker takes care of an infected person\\n\\nComplications\\n\\nAlthough most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people.', 'Older adults or people with existing chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 .', 'Complications can include:\\n\\nPneumonia in both lungs\\n\\nOrgan failure in several organs\\n\\nRespiratory failure\\n\\nHeart problems, such as heart rhythm problems and a disease of the heart muscle that makes it hard for your heart to pump blood to the body

your risk of infection.', 'WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding COVID-19 :\\n\\nAvoid large events and mass gatherings.', 'Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.', 'Stay home as much as possible and keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) if COVID-19 is spreading in your
